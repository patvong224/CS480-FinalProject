# CS480-FinalProject

This project was created in my CS 480 Database Systems class, as a way to get acclimated to database system design, it was created in the summer of 2022.
My partner and I decided to create an incredibly bare bones replica of the platform Steam, where a publisher would create a game and customer would purchase said game.
My partner focued primiarily on the database creation while I created the front end.
